# 📉 Advanced Risk Management Coursework  
### University of Amsterdam – MSc in Finance

This repository contains Python scripts and analysis completed as part of the **Advanced Risk Management** course at the University of Amsterdam. The coursework applies financial theory and empirical techniques to measure, model, and manage risk in financial markets.

---

## 🧠 Course Objectives

- Understand and quantify financial risk (market, credit, liquidity)
- Apply statistical and econometric models to risk measurement
- Evaluate risk-adjusted performance using metrics like Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES)
- Simulate portfolio risk under various stress and scenario conditions

---

## 📚 Topics Covered

- Historical and parametric VaR
- Monte Carlo simulation and bootstrapping
- GARCH models for volatility forecasting
- Copula-based dependency modeling
- Credit risk modeling (e.g., Merton model)
- Extreme value theory and tail risk
